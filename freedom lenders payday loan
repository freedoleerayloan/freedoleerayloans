Credit unions help members through programs that encourage saving and increase financial literacy. But when members are struggling to make ends meet, they often look for immediate financial assistance. So payday lenders step in with an offer that some folks canâ€™t refuse: a loan averaging $375 with an appealing fixed fee, usually provided in less time than it takes to have a pizza delivered.

Payday loans often turn into months-long ordeals that cost customers more in fees than they receive in credit. But on the front end, speed and ready access to credit are major selling points of payday loans. (Seven in 10 customers report focusing primarily on speed or convenience, as opposed to cost, when choosing where to borrow.) So, to entice members to use lower-cost, more reasonably structured installment options, credit unions will need to issue small loans very quickly.

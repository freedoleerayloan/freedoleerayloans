Federal regulators have an important role to play in making that possible. First, regulators should continue to support the NCUA’s Payday Alternative Loan (PAL) program. These loans cost six to seven times less than a payday loan. With maximum charges of 28 percent annualized interest and a $20 application fee, effective APRs range from 35 to 148 percent depending on a loan’s size and duration. While these rates are high, the small principal amount results in low costs for the member. For example, a three-month, $300 loan with an APR of 69 percent would cost only $35. In a recent survey, 85 percent of Americans said the terms of such a loan were fair.

Credit unions that have participated in the PAL program deserve recognition for their efforts. The program’s efficacy is reflected in a surprisingly low charge-off rate of just 2 percent, which is partially attributable to the fact that borrowers are already credit union members who make regular deposits to their checking accounts and typically repay via electronic debit. Yet the PAL program has tight revenue constraints, which is one reason that few of these loans are issued. About 1 in 7 federal credit unions currently participates in the PAL program, and they issued approximately 170,000 loans in 2014—just a sliver of the overall market with far less than 1 percent of the volume of payday loans issued that year.
